## Start

One day, a horse with a man on its back. It's a white horse that looked like it had a gentle temperament. At that moment, the man got off the horse and drew his long sword which was stained with blood. He walked to the river about 500 feet behind him. There was nothing except bodies all over the ground. When he reached the river, he washed his face with his hands which dipped into some clean water. The cloud was broken by the sun. At the same time, a dragon loomed over the river. With a gleam of sunlight, the man was burned by dragon's fire. In this world, the last man was dead. The rest of everything was in dismay.
